# APPM3040A - Scientific Computing III Notes

## Overview

This repository contains my personal notes for **APPM3040A - Scientific Computing III** at the **University of the Witwatersrand**. The goal of this repo is to create a structured and well-documented collection of lecture notes, derivations, problem solutions, and computational techniques relevant to the course.

The notes are written in **Markdown** and may include **LaTeX equations**, **Python code snippets**, and **Jupyter Notebook visualizations** for better understanding of key concepts.

## Contents

The repository will be organized into **chapters** based on the course structure. Each chapter will contain:
- **Conceptual explanations** of the topics covered.
- **Mathematical derivations** with LaTeX-rendered formulas.
- **Code implementations** (where applicable) for numerical methods and simulations.
- **Examples and solutions** to exercises.

### Current Progress:
This is a work in progress. Notes will be uploaded as the course progresses.
